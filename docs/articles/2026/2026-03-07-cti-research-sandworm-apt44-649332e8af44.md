## Methodology & Evidence Labels

This document uses five evidence labels applied consistently to every factual claim.

**Observed**means directly documented technical evidence in primary technical, government, or legal reporting — for example, malware behavior, sample metadata, protocol usage, or deployment mechanics.

**Reported**means described by reputable external sources with strong credibility but without full victim-side telemetry disclosure.

**Assessed**means analytic inference synthesized from multiple Observed or Reported items; it is not standalone proof.

**Claimed**means actor or persona assertions without sufficient independent technical corroboration.

**Partially corroborated**is used in the Confirmed vs Claimed section when at least one technical artifact exists but the complete incident kill-chain is not public. Press-only narratives do not qualify.

&gt; Analytic rule: Vendor naming overlap indicates cluster convergence, not guaranteed incident-level identity.

## Confidence & What Changes Confidence

**High confidence**requires independent multi-source convergence across both technical and legal/government evidence.

**Medium-High confidence**reflects strong convergence with minor incident-level artifact gaps.

**Medium confidence**reflects partially convergent data with unresolved contradictions.

**Low confidence**applies to claim-led narratives lacking technical corroboration.

**What increases confidence:**victim telemetry, full malware samples, infrastructure reuse with temporal overlap, legal attribution, and corroborated OT forensics.

**What decreases confidence:**single-source claims, circular citation loops, and unresolved source conflicts.

## Executive Summary

Mandiant formally designated Sandworm as**APT44**on April 17, 2024.[R1]The cluster is assessed as one of the most capable and risk-tolerant cyber sabotage actors linked to the Russian military intelligence system — specifically the**GRU Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST — Главный центр специальных технологий), Military Unit 74455**. The operational profile integrates espionage, destructive IT/OT disruption, and influence operations into a unified wartime playbook.[R1][R2][R4][R9]

&gt; Note on organizational structure: GTsST is a Centre (organizational unit) subordinate to the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GU), commonly referred to in the West as the GRU. The correct formal hierarchy is: GTsST → GU (Main Directorate) → General Staff. GTsST is not itself a “directorate.”

Historically, the cluster has demonstrated repeated cyber-physical impact against energy infrastructure and broad collateral effects through destructive malware campaigns. Landmark operations include the Ukraine grid attacks (2015/2016), NotPetya (2017), the Olympic Destroyer operation (2018), and the April 2022 Industroyer2 attack chain. Wartime-era adaptation has emphasized edge-device access, Active Directory abuse, and wiper deployment tempo.[R1][R2][R4][R6][R8][R9]

Recent reporting (2024–2026) reveals four parallel trends:

- **Operational scaling through edge misconfiguration targeting:**Amazon Threat Intelligence (December 2025) assessed with high confidence that a campaign active since at least 2021, consistent with Sandworm/APT44 tradecraft and infrastructure overlap, pivoted away from zero-day exploitation toward systematically targeting misconfigured customer network edge devices as primary initial access vectors. Credential harvesting via passive packet interception was the assessed collection method, with subsequent replay against victim online services.[R29]

- **Tooling continuity with iteration:**from Industroyer/Industroyer2 to Kapeka/KnuckleTouch (2022+), SwiftSlicer (2023), ZEROLOT (2024–2025), Sting, ZOV, DynoWiper, and LazyWiper (2025–2026), with code and logic overlap patterns in several cases.[R16][R21][R22][R23][R27][R30]

- **Expanded battlespace:**Android military targeting (Infamous Chisel), Signal and Telegram message exfiltration from captured battlefield devices (WaveSign tool), drone supply-chain targeting, telecom-disruption tooling (AcidPour), Bellingcat attribution, and globally distributed access operations (BadPilot subgroup).[R1][R10][R14][R28]

- **Influence-front integration:**[Reported] Mandiant’s September 2022 report initially assessed with moderate confidence that Telegram personas (XakNet Team, Infoccentr, CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn) coordinated with GRU-sponsored actors, with the supporting intrusion activity at that time attributed to APT28. In April 2024, Mandiant re-analyzed the incident data and re-attributed the relevant intrusion activity (formerly tracked as UNC3810) to APT44 with high confidence, after parsing overlapping APT28 and APT44 activity in the same network. Persona-level organizational affiliation with GRU operators remains moderate-confidence. [R1][R25]

**Bottom line:**APT44 remains a persistent, high-severity threat to critical infrastructure and strategic sectors globally. Defenders need architecture-level controls (edge, AD, OT segmentation) and behavior-based detection of administrative abuse — not IOC-only postures.

## Actor Overview

**Primary designation:**Sandworm / APT44

**Attribution core:**GRU Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST — Главный центр специальных технологий), Military Unit 74455, supported by legal and government attribution and long-horizon technical continuity.[R4][R5][R9]

**Operational identity:**Sabotage-forward, full-spectrum actor with demonstrated willingness to accept operational exposure for strategic impact.

**Mission pillars (assessed):**

- **Espionage and pre-positioning**— access development, credential and network intelligence, battlefield targeting data

- **Destructive and disruptive cyber operations**— IT and OT, kinetically coordinated in select cases

- **Influence signaling and narrative amplification**— persona ecosystem, public claims, information confrontation doctrine[R1][R2][R9]

## Alias / Cluster Crosswalk

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*f-RirHf2jl2vS7SyqZxTNg.png" alt="Article image" width="2752" height="1536" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

**APT44**is tracked under a large number of designations across vendors and government agencies. The following covers all publicly documented labels.

**Sandworm Team**— Historical/public label. Longstanding designation in government and vendor reporting.[R4][R9]

**APT44**— Mandiant normalized cluster label. Formalized April 17, 2024.[R1]

**Seashell Blizzard / IRIDIUM / Voodoo Bear**— Vendor naming variants. Microsoft and cross-vendor alias ecosystem.[R10][R24]

**FROZENBARENTS**— Vendor naming variant. Used in Google/Mandiant internal tracking taxonomy alongside APT44; appears in cross-vendor correlation contexts.[R1]

**Iron Viking**— Vendor naming variant. Secureworks (CTU) tracking designation for overlapping Sandworm-era activity.

**Quedagh**— Historical label. Used by F-Secure (2014) in early BlackEnergy/Sandworm tracking context; one of the oldest documented aliases. Not widely used in current reporting.

**Blue Echidna**— Vendor naming variant. Dragos tracking designation for Sandworm/APT44 industrial-focused activity cluster.

**TEMP.Noble**— Vendor naming variant. Google/Mandiant internal pre-APT designation used in historical tracking before formal APT44 graduation.[R1]

**UAC-0082 / UAC-0113**— CERT-UA tracking identifiers. Ukrainian CERT-UA identifiers for Sandworm-attributed activity clusters. Appear frequently in CERT-UA bulletins; critical for analysts working in Ukrainian operational context.

**UAC-0125 / UAC-0133**— CERT-UA tracking identifiers. Additional CERT-UA cluster identifiers associated with Sandworm-adjacent activity in Ukrainian incident reporting.

**Hades**— Operation-level tracking label. Used by select vendors as a tracking label for the Olympic Destroyer operation (2018). Not a standalone threat actor designation in MITRE ATT&CK or most vendor frameworks — Mandiant now attributes the underlying activity to APT44. Does not imply a separate actor cluster.

**Telebots / Electrum / BlackEnergy-era labels**— Historical labels in vendor-era reporting. Associated in some reporting with overlapping Sandworm-era activity; not strict synonyms across vendor taxonomies.[R8][R9][R15][R24]

**GTsST / Unit 74455**— Organizational attribution. GRU military unit designation tied to operations through legal and government sources.[R4][R5][R9]

&gt; Note: “Olympic Destroyer” is the name of the 2018 Winter Games disruption operation, not a standalone APT44 alias. Some vendors tracked it as a sub-cluster; Mandiant now attributes the underlying activity to APT44. [R4][R8]

&gt; [Assessed] Cross-vendor labels represent tracking-model differences around an overlapping operational ecosystem centered on GTsST/Unit 74455.

## Key Judgments

**KJ1 — APT44 is a full-spectrum military cyber actor.**It blends access, disruption, and influence into one unified doctrine rather than operating as a pure espionage cluster.**Confidence: High.**[R1][R2][R9]

**KJ2 — Cyber-kinetic synchronization is a recurring pattern.**Reported operations repeatedly align with broader Russian military pressure windows (e.g., the October 2022 OT disruption coordinated with kinetic strikes on Ukraine’s energy grid).*Cyber-kinetic synchronization: the alignment of cyber disruption operations with conventional military actions to achieve combined operational effect.***Confidence: High.**[R1][R3][R9][R12]

**KJ3 — Tradecraft has evolved toward scalable disruption.**Edge compromise + Living-off-the-Land (LotL) + GPO deployment patterns reduce dependency on bespoke ICS/OT-layer malware per operation.*Note: This refers specifically to reduced dependency on bespoke ICS/OT payloads. Bespoke IT-layer destructive tooling (wipers) continues to be developed, as addressed in KJ4.***Confidence: High.**[R2][R10][R21][R29]

**KJ4 — Destructive capability remains active and iterating in 2025–2026.**ZEROLOT/Sting/ZOV/DynoWiper/LazyWiper reporting indicates continued wiper development tempo; the tooling family is operationally iterative, not static.**Confidence: Medium-High.**[R20][R21][R22][R23][R30]

**KJ5 — Attribution is strongest at cluster level; individual incidents may be contested.**The December 2025 Poland event is a material case of inter-vendor attribution divergence.**Confidence: Medium-High (cluster), Medium (incident-specific).**[R22][R23]

**KJ6 — Influence personas are an assessed support layer, not a proven command-integrated branch.**“Telegraphing success” behavior can outpace forensic closure and force premature response decisions.**Confidence: Medium.**[R1][R2][R25]

**KJ7 — Edge management exposure and weak identity controls remain high-leverage recurring weaknesses.**Public incident data shows repeated reliance on exposed management interfaces, weak/default credentials, and absent MFA as initial enablers for high-impact sabotage chains.**Confidence: High.**[R23][R26][R29]

**KJ8 — APT44 demonstrates a doctrinal shift toward tactical battlefield support.**Since at least 2023, operations have included provisioning Signal/Telegram exfiltration infrastructure for Russian ground forces, drone supply-chain targeting, and battlefield device exploitation — a qualitative expansion beyond strategic disruption.**Confidence: High.**[R1][R28]

**KJ9 — Criminal ecosystem integration is an established pattern.**APT44 has increasingly sourced tools and bulletproof hosting infrastructure from criminal marketplaces, treating them as a disposable capability layer.**Confidence: Medium-High.**[R1]

## Attribution Assessment

Attribution to the GRU Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST — Главный центр специальных технологий), Military Unit 74455, is among the strongest in modern public cyber-intelligence for a destructive actor cluster.

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*22riGGiEEYKXEXvMREXVcQ.png" alt="Article image" width="2752" height="1536" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

&gt; Note: GTsST (Главный центр специальных технологий) is a Centre (organizational unit) within the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GU), commonly referred to in the West as the GRU. The correct formal structure is: GTsST → GU (Main Directorate) → General Staff. GTsST is not itself a “directorate” — it is a subordinate Centre within GU/GRU.

### Attribution Pillars

**Legal attribution:**U.S. DOJ indictment (October 19, 2020) charging six Unit 74455 officers for multiple campaigns — Ukraine grid incidents, NotPetya, Olympic-related operations, and others.[R4][R5]

**Government attribution convergence:**UK statements and profiles repeatedly linking major incidents to Unit 74455/GTsST, including BlackEnergy, Industroyer, NotPetya, BadRabbit, the Georgia defacements, and Olympic Destroyer.[R6][R7][R8][R9]

**Technical continuity:**Malware and procedure lineage from BlackEnergy/Industroyer-era tradecraft through Kapeka, current destructive wiper families, and edge/LotL operational methods.[R2][R13][R15][R16][R22][R27]

**Vendor convergence:**Mandiant APT44 framing + Microsoft Seashell Blizzard tracking + ESET long-horizon destructive campaign evidence + Amazon Threat Intelligence 2025 campaign assessment.[R1][R10][R20][R21][R22][R29]

### Legal Attribution Granularity (Observed)

The DOJ indictment[R4]names six GRU Unit 74455 officers tied to disruptive operations:

- **Yuriy Sergeyevich Andrienko**

- **Sergey Vladimirovich Detistov**

- **Pavel Valeryevich Frolov**

- **Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev**

- **Artem Valeryevich Ochichenko**

- **Petr Nikolayevich Pliskin**

[Assessed] This level of public legal granularity materially strengthens attribution confidence versus vendor-only clustering, especially for long-horizon historical campaigns.

## Important Caveat: Incident-Level Attribution

**December 2025 Poland incident:**ESET attributes DynoWiper to Sandworm with medium confidence; CERT Polska reports stronger overlap with infrastructure historically tracked as: Berserk Bear (CrowdStrike), Ghost Blizzard (Microsoft), Dragonfly / TEMP.Isotope (Symantec/Secureworks), and Static Tundra (less widely used). These labels represent different vendor tracking models for an overlapping activity cluster, not a single formally attributed group.[R22][R23]

**Assessment:**This is a material attribution divergence and must be represented explicitly in confidence modeling for that incident.

## Activity Timeline (2009–2026)

&gt; Timeline entries are [Reported] unless explicitly marked [Assessed] or [Observed/Reported] .

### 2009–2014 (Pre-Blackout Development Period)

- [Reported] Unit 74455/GTsST tracked as active since at least 2009 in destructive/disruptive ecosystem context.[R9]

- [Reported] ICS-targeting preparatory activity and BlackEnergy-lineage compromise patterns observed over multi-year periods.[R15]

- [Reported] Sandworm exploited a Windows zero-day[(CVE-2014–4114)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-4114)via weaponized Microsoft Office documents, affecting Windows Vista through 8.1. This was the first publicly documented Sandworm zero-day.

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*o1z9DZ7bXhpvSrJ_WtkJxw.png" alt="Article image" width="1010" height="510" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

### December 2015 (Ukraine Grid Disruption)

- [Reported] BlackEnergy/KillDisk-linked disruption affecting electricity service to approximately 225,000 customers across three distribution companies.[R4][R7][R9]

- [Assessed] Marked operational shift from intrusion to strategic critical infrastructure impact with deliberate kinetic effect.

### December 2016 (Kyiv Grid / Industroyer)

- [Observed/Reported] Industroyer framework deployed for ICS protocol-level operations in electric infrastructure; linked to the Kyiv (Pivnichna substation) outage event on December 17, 2016.[R9][R15]

### 2017 (NotPetya and BadRabbit)

- [Reported] NotPetya destructive campaign launched on June 27, 2017 — timed to coincide with Ukraine’s Constitution Day — with global collateral effects far beyond the initial Ukrainian theater. NotPetya was distributed via the update mechanism of M.E.Doc, a widely used Ukrainian accounting software package, enabling simultaneous delivery to all M.E.Doc users.[R4][R6][R9]

- [Reported — Medium confidence] BadRabbit disruptive ransomware-style event (October 2017). The UK government profile[R9]includes BadRabbit in its list of Unit 74455 operations without qualification; however, independent technical corroboration across vendors (ESET, Kaspersky) remains at medium confidence, attributing it to Telebots/Sandworm. Per this document’s confidence model, High confidence requires multi-source convergence across both technical and legal/government evidence. Government attribution alone does not elevate BadRabbit to High confidence; the absence of full technical convergence keeps this assessment at Medium. Treat as [Reported — Medium confidence] pending additional technical corroboration.

### 2018 (Olympic Destroyer and Novichok-Linked Intrusions)

- [Reported] Olympic Destroyer operation disrupted the opening ceremony of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in response to Russia’s doping ban, employing notable false-flag tradecraft elements designed to mislead attribution.[R4][R8][R9]

- [Reported] Attempted intrusions against entities linked to Novichok investigations (OPCW/DSTL context).[R4][R9]

### 2019 (Georgia Defacement Campaign)

- [Reported] Large-scale disruptive defacement of approximately 15,000 Georgian websites and interruption of broadcast services attributed by UK/NCSC to GRU unit ecosystem.[R7][R8]

### 2019–2022 (Kapeka/KnuckleTouch Backdoor Development)

- [Reported] Kapeka backdoor (tracked by Microsoft as KnuckleTouch) deployed in targeted attacks against Eastern Europe — including Ukraine and Estonia — since at least mid-2022. WithSecure attributes Kapeka to Sandworm/APT44 based on configuration and code overlaps with GreyEnergy (a prior APT44 tool) and Prestige ransomware. Kapeka is assessed as a likely successor to GreyEnergy in Sandworm’s modular espionage toolkit.[R27]

- [Reported] Kapeka was likely used in intrusions that led to the deployment of Prestige ransomware in late 2022, which targeted transportation and logistics companies in Ukraine and Poland.[R27]

### 2021–2025 (Edge Misconfiguration-Focused Access Campaign)

- [Reported] Amazon Threat Intelligence (ATI), published December 15, 2025, assessed with high confidence that a sustained GRU-associated campaign active since at least 2021 pivoted from vulnerability exploitation toward targeting misconfigured customer network edge devices as primary initial access vectors. The campaign targeted energy sector organizations, critical infrastructure providers, and telecom companies in North America and Europe. Assessed collection method: passive packet interception of authentication traffic on compromised devices, followed by credential replay against victim online services.[R29]

- [Reported] ATI identified infrastructure overlap with “Curly COMrades” — a cluster tracked by Bitdefender employing post-exploitation techniques including Hyper-V abuse for EDR evasion and custom implants CurlyShell and CurlCat. ATI assesses these may represent complementary operations within a broader GRU campaign (one cluster focused on initial access/network pivot, the other on host-based persistence).[R29]

### February 2022 (Cyclops Blink Public Exposure + Wiper Wave)

- [Observed/Reported] Cyclops Blink framework exposed by NCSC/CISA/NSA/FBI joint advisory as a modular SOHO/edge malware with firmware-update persistence and TLS-based C2.[R13][R26]

- [Reported] Microsoft documented early wartime wiper malware targeting Ukrainian organizations beginning in January 2022.[R12]

### April 2022 (Industroyer2 + Multi-Wiper Attack Chain)

- [Observed/Reported] Industroyer2 attempt against a Ukrainian energy provider; companion wipers (CaddyWiper, ORCSHRED, SOLOSHRED, AWFULSHRED) deployed in coordinated fashion across Windows, Linux, and Solaris ecosystems simultaneously.[R16][R17]

### October 2022 (MicroSCADA Native-Binary Disruption)

- [Observed/Reported] Mandiant documented an OT disruption attempt using native MicroSCADA tooling (`scilc.exe`) and staged scripts/ISO artifacts, executed during Russia's winter military campaign of strikes against Ukraine's energy grid.[R3]

- [Assessed] High-signal example of OT LotL (Living-off-the-Land) execution — reducing payload footprint and accelerating operational execution against industrial targets.

### 2022–2023 (Battlefield Intelligence and Tactical Support Expansion)

- [Reported] Since at least April 2023, APT44 provisioned dedicated infrastructure and produced Russian-language instructions to enable Russian ground forces to extract Signal and Telegram communications from mobile devices captured on the battlefield. APT44 deployed the WaveSign tool — a lightweight Windows batch script — to periodically query and exfiltrate Signal messages from a victim’s local Signal database.[R1][R28]

- [Reported] A lethal kinetic strike on Ukraine’s 128th Mountain Assault Brigade in November 2023 was traced to the penetration of a soldier’s Signal account, illustrating the operational consequences of this intelligence capability.[R28]

- [Reported] APT44 targeted the drone supply chain — including manufacturing, logistics, and Ukrainian military training programs (spear-phishing campaign impersonating a drone warfare training school, exploiting CVE-2023–38831).[R1][R28]

- [Reported] APT44 conducted a supply-chain attack against a software developer, resulting in the downstream compromise of critical infrastructure networks in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and the deployment of wiper malware.[R1]

- [Reported] APT44 targeted Bellingcat and other investigative journalism entities in a phishing campaign between December 2023 and January 2024 — first public attribution of this targeting to APT44.[R1]

### 2022–2024 (Hacktivist-Persona Coordination Layer)

- [Reported] In September 2022, Mandiant initially attributed the intrusion activity supporting Telegram personas (XakNet Team, Infoccentr, CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn) to APT28, based on observed network co-habitation. In April 2024, re-analysis of the incident data allowed Mandiant to parse overlapping APT28 and APT44 activity and link the CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn-associated intrusion activity to APT44 with high confidence. Persona-level organizational affiliation with GRU remains moderate-confidence.[R1][R25]

- [Reported] CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn (CARR) posted videos on January 17–18, 2024, claiming manipulation of HMI panels at water utilities in Poland and the United States. A U.S. local official subsequently confirmed a system malfunction causing a tank overflow at one claimed facility. Exact causal link to CARR/APT44 not fully established.[R1]

- [Reported] In March 2024, CARR claimed disruption of energy generation at a French hydroelectric facility by manipulating water levels. Verifiable causal link remains unconfirmed.[R1]

### 2023 (Doctrine Formalization + Mobile Expansion)

- [Reported] Mandiant published the GRU disruptive playbook model: edge foothold → LotL → GPO abuse → disruptive payload → claim amplification.[R2]

- [Observed/Reported] Infamous Chisel Android malware documented against Ukrainian military devices, providing Tor-backed access, modified Dropbear SSH, local network scanning, and data exfiltration of battlefield management app data.[R14]

- [Reported] SwiftSlicer wiper deployed against Ukrainian targets in 2023 — an additional destructive family in Sandworm’s iterative wiper portfolio.[R30]

### 2024 (APT44 Naming + Expanded Tooling + Telecom Disruption)

- [Reported] Mandiant formally graduated Sandworm to APT44, citing global scope and military integration across the full spectrum of espionage, attack, and influence.[R1]

- [Reported] Kapeka/KnuckleTouch formally tracked and publicly reported by WithSecure and Microsoft; attributed to APT44/Seashell Blizzard.[R27]

- [Reported] AcidPour (AcidRain variant) observed with expanded destructive capability against Linux UBI/device-mapper storage topologies; attributed to a Sandworm-linked subcluster by SentinelOne based on infrastructure overlap with the Solntsepek persona. Treat as [Reported], medium confidence.[R19]

- [Reported] APT44 has experimented with ransomware deployment against European transportation and logistics networks — an operational expansion beyond pure sabotage/espionage.[R1]

- [Reported] APT44 continued large-scale credential theft targeting public and private sector mail servers globally (Exim, Zimbra, Exchange), dating back to at least 2019.[R1]

- [Reported] APT44 increasingly sourced tools and bulletproof hosting from criminal marketplaces as a disposable operational layer.[R1]

### 2025 (High-Tempo Wiper Period + Edge Pivot Confirmation)

- [Reported] ESET reports Sandworm deployment of ZEROLOT and Sting against Ukrainian government, energy, logistics, and grain sectors.[R20][R21]

- [Reported] ESET notes UAC-0099 initial-access handoff to Sandworm for follow-on operations.[R21]

- [Reported] Microsoft documents continued global access operations by Seashell Blizzard/BadPilot subgroup, including exploitation of U.S./UK internet-facing systems.[R10]

- [Reported] Amazon Threat Intelligence campaign confirmed sustained focus on edge-device targeting through end of 2025; APT44 maintained this posture while reducing N-day/zero-day exploitation investment.[R29]

### December 2025 — January 2026 (Poland Energy/Industrial Incident)

- [Observed/Reported] CERT Polska reports coordinated destructive attacks across more than 30 renewable energy sites, a CHP entity, and a manufacturing target; IT+OT impact attempts including firmware tampering and wiper deployment.[R23]

- [Reported] ESET attributes DynoWiper to Sandworm with medium confidence and documents ZOV/DynoWiper logic overlap.[R22]

- [Observed/Reported] Recurring preconditions across affected sites: FortiGate VPN exposed to the internet without MFA and extensive credential reuse risk.[R23]

- [Observed/Reported] OT impact mechanics: RTU firmware sabotage (inserted bytes causing reboot loops), device-level destructive commands, attacker-performed factory reset of edge appliances to hinder restoration and erase traces.[R23]

- [Observed/Reported] Enterprise escalation chain: LSASS dumping, NTDS.dit/SAM/SYSTEM theft, Kerberos ticket abuse (Diamond Ticket), domain-wide GPO/scheduled-task wiper rollout.[R23]

- [Assessed] Attribution for this incident remains contested (ESET vs. CERT Polska) and should remain medium confidence pending additional corroboration.

### Timeline Synthesis

- [Assessed] APT44 evolved from selective high-impact bespoke attacks into repeatable, scalable disruption operations integrating edge access + privileged orchestration + rapid destructive payloading.

- [Assessed] Concurrent with destructive operations, APT44 has pursued a qualitative expansion into tactical battlefield support, signal intelligence collection, and criminal marketplace integration.

- [Assessed] 2025–2026 reporting indicates sustained destructive capability rather than de-escalation.

- [Reported]**Energy and utilities (IT+OT):**grid operations, substations, CHP, renewable interconnect points, hydroelectric facilities.[R1][R3][R9][R23]

- [Reported]**Government and military-adjacent institutions:**strategic state pressure, wartime support functions, battlefield command-and-control systems.[R1][R4][R10]

- [Reported]**Telecommunications:**disruption and intelligence leverage against communications environments, including interception of battlefield communications.[R19][R28]

- [Reported]**Logistics/transport/manufacturing/grain/drone supply chain:**strategic economy pressure and operational friction; APT44 has directly targeted drone manufacturing, training, and logistics.[R1][R10][R21]

- [Reported]**Edge and identity control plane assets:**VPN gateways, firewall management surfaces, domain controllers, and identity infrastructure repeatedly appear as decisive enabling layers.[R10][R23][R26][R29]

- [Reported]**Civil society, investigative journalism, and NGOs:**Bellingcat, OPCW-linked entities, and similar organizations targeted for influence-related purposes.[R1]

- [Reported]**Democratic processes and election infrastructure:**APT44 has attempted to interfere with democratic processes in multiple countries through data leaks and election system access.[R1]

- [Assessed]**NATO-adjacent and global expansion:**opportunistic access campaigns create latent options beyond immediate conflict zones; ATI campaign documented targeting in North America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East.[R10][R29]

## Operational Doctrine: Evolution

### Phase 1: Bespoke High-Impact Disruption (2015–2018)

Heavy focus on custom destructive tooling and strategic signaling events. Strong OT specialization with Industroyer-class capabilities. False-flag tradecraft deployed in Olympic Destroyer to complicate attribution.[R9][R15]

### Phase 2: Blended Sabotage + Deniability (2019–2022)

Continued destructive operations with increased use of public-facing cover narratives, hacktivist personas, and expanded edge-device persistence.[R8][R13]

&gt; Phases 3 and 4 are concurrent, not sequential — they represent parallel operational tracks from 2022 onward.

### Phase 3 (Tactical): Scaled Wartime Playbook (2022–Present)

Repeatable operational cycle emphasizing speed, scalability, and survivability. As described by Mandiant[R2]:

- Living on the edge — initial access via exposed or misconfigured edge devices

- Living off the land — LotL execution with native tooling

- Going for GPO / privileged orchestration — domain-wide reach

- Disrupt and deny — wiper and OT payload deployment

- Telegraphing success — persona-layer claim amplification

### Phase 4 (Influence Layer): Distributed Amplification and Attribution Friction (2022–Present)

Persona-layer messaging assessed as coordinated or adjacent in selected cases; can increase perceived impact before forensic closure. Analysts must separate tactical defensive response (TTP-driven) from unresolved incident-level attribution disputes.[R23][R25]

### Phase 5 (Battlefield Integration): Tactical Intelligence and Kinetic Support (2023–Present)

Qualitative doctrinal expansion documented in 2024 Mandiant APT44 report and RUSI analysis: direct support to Russian ground forces through Signal/Telegram exfiltration infrastructure, WaveSign tooling, drone supply-chain targeting, and battlefield management system penetration.[R1][R28]

&gt; [Assessed] The doctrinal arc runs from “single flagship capability” → “repeatable campaign system” → “integrated battlefield intelligence support service.” Each phase expands APT44’s operational mandate rather than replacing prior capabilities.

## Initial Access and Privilege Escalation Patterns (Observed 2021–2026)

- [Reported] Microsoft documents BadPilot campaign exploiting vulnerabilities in ConnectWise ScreenConnect (`[CVE-2024-1709](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-1709)`), Fortinet FortiClient EMS (`[CVE-2023-48788](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-48788)`), Microsoft Exchange (`[CVE-2021-34473](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-34473)`), Zimbra (`[CVE-2022-41352](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2022-41352)`), WatchGuard (`[CVE-2022-26318](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2022-26318)`), and Confluence (`[CVE-2021-26084](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-26084)`,`[CVE-2023-22518](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-22518)`).[R10][R29]

- [Reported] Amazon Threat Intelligence 2025 campaign: primary initial access vector shifted to misconfigured customer network edge devices (routers, VPN concentrators, network appliances) rather than active vulnerability exploitation — passive packet interception assessed as credential collection method.[R29]

- [Observed/Reported] CERT Polska incident: initial footholds via FortiGate VPN surfaces without MFA; account takeover and privilege escalation into AD/OT management layers.[R23]

- [Observed/Reported] Post-compromise escalation: LSASS credential dumping, NTDS.dit/SAM/SYSTEM extraction, Kerberos ticket abuse (Diamond Ticket) to sustain privileged domain control.[R23]

## Deep Technical Analysis of Key Families

### Industroyer / Industroyer2

- [Observed/Reported] Industroyer framework includes ICS protocol-specific modules:**IEC 60870–5–101**,**IEC 60870–5–104**,**IEC 61850**, and**OPC DA**— designed to send malicious commands directly to substation equipment over legitimate industrial protocols.[R15]

- [Observed/Reported] Industroyer also includes a**fifth module**: a Denial-of-Service tool targeting Siemens SIPROTEC 4 and Compact protective relay devices via**CVE-2015–5374**. The module sends a crafted 18-byte UDP packet to port 50000, placing the device into “firmware update” mode and rendering it unresponsive until manually rebooted. This directly disables substation protection functions (“Loss of Protection” impact), meaning the grid loses automatic fault isolation capability — amplifying the physical impact of the attack beyond the outage itself. SIPROTEC relays are widely deployed in substations globally.[R15]

- [Observed/Reported] Industroyer2 showed more target-tailored, hardcoded behavior (reduced modularity) and was deployed in a coordinated attack chain with CaddyWiper/ORCSHRED/SOLOSHRED/AWFULSHRED.[R16][R17]

- [Assessed] The reduced modularity of Industroyer2 versus the original Industroyer suggests operators possessed highly specific target intelligence, reducing the need for broad protocol flexibility.

### Cyclops Blink

- [Observed] NCSC malware analysis describes a modular Linux ELF framework with: firmware-update persistence (survives device resets), custom C2 over TLS with random server/port fallback logic, process masquerading (`[kworker:0/1]`kernel-thread style), and iptables rule injection to open attacker-controlled ports.[R13]

- [Observed] Module extensibility at runtime allows capability updates without full redeployment.[R13]

- [Assessed] Cyclops Blink materially improves long-term edge resilience compared to opportunistic one-off footholds; its firmware-persistence model is specifically designed to outlast standard incident response.

### Kapeka / KnuckleTouch

- [Reported] Kapeka is a 32-bit/64-bit Windows DLL backdoor with a self-removing dropper. Persistence is established via either a scheduled task or autorun registry key depending on privilege level. C2 configuration is AES-256-encrypted and persisted in the registry. C2 communication uses JSON.[R27]

- [Reported] Overlaps with GreyEnergy include: identical custom data-structuring algorithm for C2 traffic, DLL format with masqueraded extension, and creation of a “Microsoft” folder in the AppData path. Key differences: Kapeka uses Windows API and registry for fingerprinting (GreyEnergy used WMI); Kapeka persists C2 config in registry (GreyEnergy used on-disk file).[R27]

- [Reported] Assessed as a likely successor to GreyEnergy; GreyEnergy itself succeeded BlackEnergy in Sandworm’s arsenal. This represents a documented three-generation toolchain.[R27]

- [Assessed] Kapeka’s infrequent sightings and bespoke targeting indicate deliberate conservation of an expensive custom tool — consistent with APT44’s documented preference for protecting high-cost capabilities.

### WaveSign (Signal Interception Tool)

- [Reported] A lightweight Windows batch script used by APT44/Seashell Blizzard to periodically query the Signal desktop message database on a victim’s machine and exfiltrate the most recent messages. Used in conjunction with infrastructure provisioned for Russian ground forces to exploit captured battlefield devices.[R28]

- [Assessed] Represents a purpose-built, low-complexity tool designed for rapid operational deployment at scale — consistent with APT44’s pattern of maintaining simple, disposable tools alongside complex bespoke capabilities.

### ZEROLOT / Sting / ZOV / DynoWiper / LazyWiper (2025–2026)

- [Reported] ESET documents repeated wiper deployment in 2025 against Ukrainian sectors.[R20][R21][R22]

- [Observed/Reported] DynoWiper: selective overwrite logic (separate handling for small vs. large files for speed optimization) and forced reboot completion behavior; ZOV code similarity noted by ESET.[R22]

- [Observed] CERT Polska: two-stage deployment via`dynacom_update.ps1`→`exp1.ps1`→`schtask.exe`via domain GPO. PowerShell logging suppression active. Anti-forensics: edge appliance factory resets, file deletion.[R23]

- [Observed] LazyWiper (`KB284726.ps1`): PowerShell-based, slower recursive destruction model; deployed alongside DynoWiper. [R23]

- [Assessed] Design philosophy prioritizes speed, broad operational effect, and GPO-scalable deployment over obfuscation depth.

### BlockBit and OT Device-Level Sabotage (2025 Poland Incident)

- [Observed] CERT Polska documents`blockbit`tooling used for automated destructive actions against RTU-facing environments: interface disablement, reboot commands, storage destruction calls, and corrupted firmware with inserted bytes causing persistent reboot loops.[R23]

- [Assessed] Demonstrates a practical IT-to-OT handoff: generic enterprise compromise translated into industrial operational impact via purpose-built OT sabotage commands — confirming the doctrinal integration described in the GRU Disruptive Playbook.[R2][R23]

[https://cert.pl/uploads/docs/CERT_Polska_Energy_Sector_Incident_Report_2025.pdf](https://cert.pl/uploads/docs/CERT_Polska_Energy_Sector_Incident_Report_2025.pdf)

## Detection and Response Priorities

- **Control the edge attack surface.**Mandatory MFA, restricted management-plane exposure, firmware integrity verification, and emergency remediation workflows for all internet-facing edge devices.

- **Instrument AD/GPO abuse pathways.**Alert on SYSVOL modifications, GPO scheduled-task creation, and unusual domain-controller script execution. Integrate with change-management ticketing for immediate anomaly detection.

- **Detect destructive precursor behavior.**Anti-recovery commands, high-rate file overwrite patterns, abnormal scheduled-task rollout velocity, and PowerShell logging suppression.

- **Harden the OT remote-access boundary.**Explicit allowlisting for OT-native administrative binaries and argument sets; command logging on all OT management endpoints.

- **Operate claim-vs-telemetry workflows.**Treat persona narratives and hacktivist claims as early warning only; require local evidence before compromise declaration.

- **Eliminate default credentials; enforce MFA universally on edge/OT remote paths.**Treat “internet-exposed + password-only authentication” as a critical-risk misconfiguration requiring immediate remediation.

- **Detect passive credential interception patterns.**Audit edge devices for packet capture utilities, unexpected file writes, and authentication relay attempts following device compromise.

- **Protect mobile and messaging security for sensitive personnel.**Enforce Signal/Telegram device-link auditing, restrict device pairing on operational devices, and maintain battlefield mobile device policy.

## Detection Engineering Pack (SOC-Ready)

### Rule 1: Edge Admin-Plane Anomaly

**Response:**Flag as destructive precursor; escalate to incident queue.

### Rule 7: Linux Process Masquerading (Cyclops Blink Pattern)

**Data sources:**EDR process + path metadata.
**Logic:**Kernel-thread-style process names (e.g.,`[kworker:0/1]`) originating from user-space executables or non-kernel paths.
**Response:**Quarantine binary; hunt for sibling deployments across estate.

### Rule 8: Firewall/iptables Rule Injection

**Data sources:**Linux auditd, appliance command logs.
**Logic:**Unexpected iptables rule additions opening non-standard ports; rule changes without a corresponding change ticket.
**Response:**Rollback policy; preserve full rule-change timeline for forensic review.

### Rule 15: NTDS/SAM/SYSTEM Theft Sequence

**Data sources:**DC file access logs, Sysmon (EventID 11/15), PowerShell logs.**Logic:**Access/copy of`NTDS.dit`+ registry hive exports (`SAM`,`SYSTEM`) from unusual process ancestry (not backup agents or authorized admin tooling).**Response:**Immediate identity-tier incident escalation; enterprise credential reset wave; forensic preservation of all DC artifacts.

### Rule 16: Edge Device Packet Capture File Detection

**Data sources:**EDR on network appliances, SIEM file telemetry.
**Logic:**Creation of`.pcap`files or invocation of`tcpdump`/`tshark`equivalents on router/VPN/firewall hosts outside maintenance windows.
**Response:**Treat as potential credential-interception staging; audit all authentication traffic through device; initiate credential rotation for all accounts transiting the device.

## Wiper/OT First 30 Minutes (Defensive Mini-Playbook)

- Declare destructive incident severity and open unified command bridge (IT + OT + Comms).

- Isolate impacted hosts/subnets and all OT remote management pathways.

- Disable suspicious privileged identities and invalidate all active tokens/sessions.

- Preserve volatile evidence: process tree, active services, command history, network sessions.

- Freeze automated deployment channels: GPO, software distribution, patch management.

- Validate immutable backup path integrity; initiate clean-room restoration protocol.

- Separate verified impact evidence from persona/claim-layer narratives in all communications.

- Trigger enterprise-wide sweep for known destructive precursor patterns (Rules 5, 6, 14, 15).

- Activate OT manual operational fallback procedures if remote management channels are compromised.

- Preserve all edge appliance logs before attacker-initiated factory resets can complete.

## Common Patterns and Cross-Group Correlation

### Common Operational Patterns

- [Assessed]**Edge footholds are strategic enablers**, not merely tactical access — they enable long-dwell credential collection and later destructive staging.

- [Assessed]**Privileged AD abuse is the enterprise force multiplier**for domain-wide destructive effects.

- [Assessed]**OT disruption increasingly combines native tool abuse with targeted destructive payloads**to reduce ICS-specific malware exposure.

- [Assessed]**Wiper tooling is iterative**, not one-off — families are renamed, retooled, and redeployed across campaigns.

- [Assessed]**Narrative operations are fused with technical action**to maximize psychological and political impact.

- [Assessed]**Identity and edge misconfiguration are the recurring high-leverage entry points**in successful destructive chains.

- [Assessed]**Anti-forensics is integrated, not optional**— factory resets, logging suppression, and cleanup actions are standard in documented incident chains.

- [Assessed]**Criminal ecosystem integration is an established force-multiplier**— sourcing disposable tools and hosting from criminal markets reduces operational exposure and development cost.

- [Assessed]**Tactical battlefield support represents a doctrinal expansion**— APT44 is no longer solely a strategic disruptor but an operational intelligence support asset for conventional forces.

### Cross-Group Correlation

The December 2025 Poland incident demonstrates that destructive TTP overlap can cross historical cluster-attribution boundaries in public models. The Kapeka toolchain (BlackEnergy → GreyEnergy → Kapeka) illustrates multi-generation tool succession across nearly a decade. Analysts must keep TTP-led defensive response independent from unresolved actor-naming disputes.

## Collection Gaps and Unresolved Questions

- Full internal tasking boundaries among Russian military cyber units (Units 74455, 26165, 161) remain opaque in open sources.

- The exact organizational relationship between GTsST/Unit 74455 and documented subgroups (BadPilot, Curly COMrades) is not fully characterized in public reporting.

- Public forensic depth is uneven across post-2024 incidents.

- The current extent of dormant pre-positioning in Western critical infrastructure outside active conflict theaters remains uncertain.

- Attribution divergence in the December 2025 Poland case requires additional independent technical reconciliation.

- The full operational scope of the WaveSign/Signal-interception program and the volume of battlefield communications successfully compromised is not publicly quantified.

- The relationship between APT44 ransomware experiments (European transport/logistics) and broader strategic intent is underdetermined.

## Practical Defensive Actions (Next 30 Days)

- **Emergency edge device audit:**inventory all internet-facing management interfaces; verify MFA enforcement; check for unexpected packet capture files; assess firmware integrity.

- **Credential hygiene sprint:**force rotation on all accounts that transit edge/VPN/OT management devices; audit for credential reuse across facilities.

- **AD/GPO detection deployment:**implement high-severity detection rules for SYSVOL modifications, new scheduled tasks, and Default Domain Policy changes; route to IR immediately.

- **Wiper behavior analytics:**build or validate detections for fast file-overwrite patterns, anti-recovery commands, PowerShell history suppression, and forced reboot scheduling.

- **OT command allowlisting:**document and enforce allowlisted invocation patterns for OT-native administrative binaries; instrument anomaly alerting for deviations.

- **Battlefield mobile policy:**audit Signal and Telegram device-link settings on operational devices; enforce device security policy for personnel with access to sensitive communications.

- **Claim-vs-telemetry process:**establish formal documented workflow separating persona/hacktivist claims from local incident evidence; enforce evidence-gated communications.

- **IR tabletop:**conduct a joint IT/OT destructive-scenario exercise incorporating the CERT Polska Poland incident chain — edge access → AD escalation → GPO wiper rollout → OT firmware sabotage.

## Appendix A: IOC Compendium (Public Reporting)

&gt; Use these IOCs for correlation and triage only , not standalone attribution.

**IOC tagging model:**

- `evidence_tag`:`hard`|`near-hard`|`soft`

- `freshness_tag`:`stable_tracking`|`durable_pattern`|`maybe_expired`|`volatile`

### ⚠️ Network IOC Shelf-Life Warning

IP addresses from incident-specific reporting (especially the December 2025 Poland incident chain) have a short operational validity window. These addresses should be considered potentially reassigned or repurposed within weeks to months of publication.**Do NOT implement as long-term blocklist entries without continuous revalidation.**Use for retrospective correlation and short-term triage only.

### Behavioral / Procedure Indicators

**🔴 HIGH PRIORITY**

`scilc.exe -do ...`against SCIL script in OT environment — near-hard / durable_pattern. OT command misuse alert. [R3]

GPO + scheduled task wiper deployment from domain controller — near-hard / durable_pattern. Domain-wide containment workflow. [R2][R21][R23]

Default Domain Policy tampering (`Files.xml`,`ScheduledTasks.xml`) — near-hard / durable_pattern. Domain policy integrity check and emergency rollback. [R23]

`.pcap`file creation or`tcpdump`invocation on network appliance outside maintenance window — near-hard / durable_pattern. Credential interception staging. [R29]

Credential replay from edge device IP against M365/cloud auth endpoint — near-hard / durable_pattern. Credential harvest confirmation. [R29]

LSASS +`NTDS.dit`/`SAM`/`SYSTEM`extraction sequence — near-hard / durable_pattern. Identity-tier incident escalation. [R23]

Kerberos ticket abuse (Diamond Ticket pattern) — near-hard / durable_pattern. KDC analytics trigger. [R23]

Wiper logic: separate handling for small vs. large files at high velocity — near-hard / durable_pattern. Destructive pattern analytics. [R22][R23]

**🟠 MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY**

PowerShell history suppression (`Set-PSReadLineOption -HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing`) — near-hard / durable_pattern. Anti-forensics detection on admin hosts. [R23]

`[kworker:0/1]`process name from user-space executable path — near-hard / durable_pattern. Linux process masquerade analytics. [R13]

Factory reset / config wipe of edge appliances during attack window — soft / durable_pattern. Anti-forensics escalation. [R23]

Slack webhook exfiltration of script output — near-hard / durable_pattern. Webhook egress alerting and containment. [R23]

Signal database file (`db.sqlite`or equivalent) accessed by unexpected process — near-hard / durable_pattern. WaveSign-type activity detection. [R28]

**Defender Usage Notes:**Prioritize multi-signal correlation over standalone IOC hits. Network IOCs from incident reporting are volatile; never use as permanent blocklist entries without revalidation. Maintain separate confidence levels for cluster attribution versus incident attribution when sources diverge. Behavioral indicators carry longer useful life than network or hash IOCs.

## Appendix B: ATT&CK-Oriented Mapping (Analyst View)

&gt; ATT&CK version note: Enterprise technique IDs (T####) reference MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise; ICS technique IDs (T0###) reference MITRE ATT&CK for ICS. This mapping was prepared against ATT&CK Enterprise v16 / ATT&CK for ICS v3 (approximate, as of March 2026). Verify sub-technique IDs and names against the current ATT&CK release at time of use — names and IDs may change between versions.

**T1190**— Exploit Public-Facing Application. Exploitation of internet-facing edge software and management surfaces. [R10][R23]

**T1133**— External Remote Services. Compromise of internet-facing edge infrastructure for initial access. [R10][R23][R29]

**T1078.003**— Valid Accounts: Local Accounts. Reuse/abuse of local credentials on edge/OT devices. [R23]

**T1040**— Network Sniffing. Passive packet capture on compromised edge devices for credential interception. [R14][R29]

**T1003.001**— OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory. Post-compromise credential harvesting for domain escalation. [R23]

**T1003.003**— OS Credential Dumping: NTDS. Theft of`NTDS.dit`and related registry hives. [R23]

**T1558**— Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets (Diamond Ticket). Diamond Ticket attack: decrypts a legitimate DC-issued TGT using the KRBTGT AES256 key, modifies the PAC to elevate privileges, and re-encrypts. Distinct from T1558.001 (Golden Ticket), which forges a TGT entirely from scratch without a legitimate AS-REQ. Diamond Ticket produces a ticket appearing to originate from the DC, making it harder to detect. No dedicated ATT&CK sub-technique exists for Diamond Ticket — map to parent T1558 only; do not conflate with T1558.001. [R23]

**T1046**— Network Service Discovery. Internal reconnaissance before destructive stage. [R23]

**T1053.005**— Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task. Wiper orchestration across domain environments. [R21][R23]

**T1569.002**— System Services: Service Execution. Remote command execution via PsExec/service context. [R23]

**T1484.001**— Domain Policy Modification: Group Policy. GPO-based distribution of destructive payloads. [R2][R21][R23]

**T1195.002**— Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Supply Chain. M.E.Doc update mechanism (NotPetya); software developer compromise (Eastern Europe/Central Asia wiper). [R1][R4]

**T1542.001**— Pre-OS Boot: System Firmware. Cyclops Blink persistence across firmware updates. [R13]

**T1036.005**— Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name/Location.`[kworker:*]`process-style kernel-thread disguise. [R13]

**T1562.004**— Impair Defenses: Disable/Modify Firewall. Edge firewall iptables rule injection. [R13]

**T1562.001**— Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools. Security control disruption during destructive operations. [R23]

**T1562.013**— Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Network Device Firewall. FortiGate configuration modification for persistence. [R23]

**T1059.001**— Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell. PowerShell-based wiper delivery and anti-forensics. [R23]

**T1222**— File and Directory Permissions Modification. Wiper-driven permission changes. [R23]

**T1070.004**— Indicator Removal: File Deletion. Cleanup/deletion by destructive scripts. [R23]

**T1071.001**— Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols. HTTP/HTTPS C2 transport. [R13][R14]

**T1573.002**— Encrypted Channel: Asymmetric Crypto. Cyclops Blink per-message TLS encryption; Kapeka AES-256 C2. [R13][R27]

**T1105**— Ingress Tool Transfer. Script and binary staging chain (`.ps1`→ executable). [R23]

**T1602.002**— Data from Configuration Repository: Network Device Configuration Dump. Firewall/network config theft. [R23]

**T1090**— Proxy. Reverse proxy and SOCKS/Tor relay in incident chains. [R23]

**T1665**— Hide Infrastructure. Compromised infrastructure for attacker communications. [R23]

**T1567.004**— Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration Over Webhook. Script output exfiltrated to Slack webhook. [R23]

**T1485**— Data Destruction. Wiper family operations across campaigns. [R16][R21][R22][R23]

**T1561.002**— Disk Wipe: Disk Structure Wipe. RAID/config destructive modification. [R23]

**T1490**— Inhibit System Recovery. Anti-recovery behavior in destructive workflows. [R2][R11]

**T1529**— System Shutdown/Reboot. Forced restart to complete wiper destruction. [R22][R23]

**T1486**— Data Encrypted for Impact. Prestige ransomware deployment against transport/logistics. [R1][R27]

**T0807**— (ICS) Command-Line Interface. OT command execution against industrial components. [R3][R23]

**T0822**— (ICS) External Remote Services. Edge-to-OT access pathway in energy incidents. [R23]

**T0835**— (ICS) Denial of Service. Industroyer SIPROTEC DoS module: crafted UDP packet to port 50000 triggers firmware-update mode on Siemens SIPROTEC 4/Compact relay devices (CVE-2015–5374), disabling protective relay function (Loss of Protection) until manual reboot. [R15]

**T0839**— (ICS) Module Firmware. RTU firmware corruption (inserted bytes causing reboot loops). [R23]

**T0886**— (ICS) Remote Services. Connection to industrial automation and RTU devices. [R23]
