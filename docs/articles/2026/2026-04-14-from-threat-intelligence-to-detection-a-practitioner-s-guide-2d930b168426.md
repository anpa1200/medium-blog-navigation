## Why IOC-Only Detection Fails

The most common detection workflow in threat intelligence consumption looks like this: receive a report, extract IPs, domains, and file hashes, push them into your firewall and EDR blocklist, mark the ticket closed. This is useful as far as it goes — blocked infrastructure is blocked infrastructure — but it answers a question no sophisticated adversary actually leaves unanswered.

IP addresses rotate. Domains age out. Hashes are trivially changed with a recompile or packer swap. A threat actor who has been operating for more than a week has almost certainly burned the IOCs that appear in public reports, because those reports describe what was found*after*the fact. By the time an IOC reaches your blocklist, the adversary has likely already moved.

The problem is structural. IOC-based detection operates at the very bottom of the[Pyramid of Pain](https://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html)— the layer where changing indicators costs the attacker almost nothing. Effective detection operates higher up the pyramid: at the level of tools, techniques, and ultimately behavioral patterns that are expensive for an adversary to modify because they are derived from operational necessity, not configuration choices.

This guide builds all five layers of detection from the behavior of three well-documented, sophisticated adversary groups. Each layer answers a different question:

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fnI8RxFwojz98-N-tQx_5Q.png" alt="Article image" width="1536" height="1024" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

A detection program that only runs at the top row is noisy and incomplete. One that only runs at the bottom row misses everything that has rotated its indicators. The goal is to run all five layers simultaneously, with increasing alert confidence as you move up.

## The Three APTs: Profiles and Why They Were Chosen

Three adversary groups were selected on four criteria: technical sophistication, public reporting depth, operational diversity, and breadth of TTPs that generate useful detection examples across all five layers.

### 1. APT29 — Midnight Blizzard / Cozy Bear (Russia, SVR)

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gldCo66m82KDzhxcn2IY6A.png" alt="Article image" width="2816" height="1536" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

**Classification:**Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), active since at least 2008
**MITRE ATT&CK:**[G0016](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016/)
**Primary mission:**Long-duration strategic espionage — government, diplomatic, think tank, and technology targets

**Why chosen:**APT29 is the canonical example of a patient, low-and-slow actor that lives almost entirely off legitimate infrastructure and signed tooling. Their 2019–2020 SolarWinds supply-chain operation (SUNBURST/TEARDROP) remains one of the most technically documented intrusions in open reporting. Their 2023–2024 Microsoft corporate network compromise via OAuth device-code phishing and application impersonation is thoroughly reported by Microsoft MSTIC. They generate rich examples for: supply chain detection, OAuth and SAML abuse, living-off-the-land detection, and long-dwell behavioral anomalies.

**Key campaigns and public reporting:**

- **SUNBURST (SolarWinds):**FireEye/Mandiant Dec 2020, CISA AA20–352A, Microsoft MSTIC Dec 2020

- **NOBELIUM / OAuth abuse:**Microsoft MSTIC Oct 2021, May 2023, Jan 2024

- **Golden SAML:**CyberArk research, Mandiant 2021 follow-up

- **WellMess / WellMail:**UK NCSC Jul 2020 advisory

**Core TTP profile:**

- T1195.002 — Supply chain compromise via software build system

- T1078.004 — Valid cloud accounts (Azure AD, M365)

- T1550.001 — Application access token abuse

- T1556.006 — Modify authentication process (Golden SAML)

- T1059.001 — PowerShell

- T1021.002 — SMB/WMI lateral movement

- T1560.001 — Archive collected data

- T1071.001 — Web protocols for C2 (HTTP/S to legitimate cloud services)

### 2. APT41 — Double Dragon / Winnti (China, MSS-linked)

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mstTspG5RXN5MoPN0SWUPw.png" alt="Article image" width="2816" height="1536" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

**Classification:**China Ministry of State Security contractor/affiliated group, active since at least 2012
**MITRE ATT&CK:**[G0096](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0096/)
**Primary mission:**Dual — state-directed espionage AND financially motivated cybercrime (ransomware, cryptocurrency theft, virtual goods)

**Why chosen:**APT41 is the clearest documented case of a single group conducting both state espionage and opportunistic cybercrime. Their toolset is wide, their targeting is broad, and their TTPs are well-documented across multiple vendor reports and U.S. DOJ indictments (2019, 2020). They generate excellent examples of: exploitation chain detection, supply chain DLL hijacking, custom malware staging, living-off-the-land with LOLBins, and multi-phase intrusion correlation.

**Key campaigns and public reporting:**

- **Operation ShadowHammer (ASUS Live Update):**Kaspersky Apr 2019

- **Healthcare/COVID research targeting:**FBI-CISA May 2020

- **Citrix/ManageEngine exploitation wave:**Mandiant 2022–2023

- **DOJ indictments:**Sep 2019 (two defendants), Sep 2020 (five defendants)

- **KEYPLUG / DEADEYE / DUSTPAN malware family:**Mandiant Apr 2022

**Core TTP profile:**

- T1190 — Exploit public-facing application (Citrix, ManageEngine, Log4Shell)

- T1505.003 — Web shell deployment

- T1574.002 — DLL side-loading (very characteristic of this group)

- T1036.005 — Match legitimate name or location (masquerading)

- T1055 — Process injection

- T1003.001 — LSASS memory dump

- T1021.006 — WinRM lateral movement

- T1567.002 — Exfiltration to cloud storage

### 3. Lazarus Group — HIDDEN COBRA / Diamond Sleet / TraderTraitor (DPRK, RGB)

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ysYb5qRjFAzwP3VadqiVpw.png" alt="Article image" width="2816" height="1536" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

**Classification:**North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), active since at least 2009
**MITRE ATT&CK:**[G0032](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032/)
**Primary mission:**Revenue generation for the DPRK regime (cryptocurrency theft, financial fraud, sanctions evasion) AND targeted espionage (defense, nuclear, aerospace)

**Why chosen:**Lazarus provides the richest set of social-engineering-to-intrusion chain examples and is uniquely documented for financial system targeting. Operation Dream Job (fake LinkedIn recruitment), AppleJeus (trojanized crypto software), and the 3CX supply chain compromise give concrete cases for initial access detection. TraderTraitor is documented extensively by CISA, FBI, and the UN Panel of Experts. They generate excellent examples of: initial access via social engineering, cross-platform malware, BYOVD (bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver), and financial API abuse.

**Key campaigns and public reporting:**

- **Operation AppleJeus:**Kaspersky Aug 2018, CISA Apr 2021 advisory (AA21–048A)

- **Operation Dream Job:**ClearSky Jan 2020, Mandiant 2022 follow-up

- **TraderTraitor (crypto targeting):**CISA/FBI/Treasury Apr 2022, FBI Mar 2023

- **3CX Supply Chain:**Mandiant/CrowdStrike Apr 2023

- **BYOVD (Dell DBUtil / POORTRY):**Mandiant Aug 2022, Microsoft Oct 2022

- **UN Panel of Experts reports:**2021, 2022, 2023

**Core TTP profile:**

- T1566.002 — Spear-phishing link (LinkedIn, email with weaponized PDF/ZIP)

- T1204.002 — User execution of malicious file

- T1195.002 — Supply chain compromise (3CX, trading software)

- T1014 — Rootkit (BYOVD with POORTRY/WHIPEDOUT)

- T1059.001 / T1059.003 — PowerShell and cmd scripting

- T1041 / T1071.001 — Exfiltration and C2 over HTTPS

- T1657 — Financial theft (cryptocurrency exchange API abuse)

- T1070.004 — File deletion / indicator removal

## Detection Taxonomy

Before building rules, it helps to be precise about what each tier detects and what data sources it requires.

### Detection Layer Definitions

**Atomic Event Rules**match a single telemetry event against a known-bad signature. The logic is essentially:`IF event.field == bad_value THEN alert`. No context required, no lookback, no correlation. Fastest to write, fastest to evade.

**Collection-Based Rules**aggregate multiple events of the*same type*over a time window and alert when a threshold is crossed:`IF count(event_type, 10 minutes) &gt; threshold THEN alert`. These detect volume-based techniques like brute force, port scanning, or bulk data staging.

**Correlational Rules**join*different*event types — process creation, network connection, file write, authentication — in a temporal sequence tied to a common entity (host, user, process). They model cause-and-effect chains: the attacker did A, then B, then C. Changing any one link breaks the rule; changing all three breaks the campaign.

**TTP-Based Rules**detect a*technique*, not a specific tool implementing that technique. A TTP-based rule for credential dumping fires whether the actor uses Mimikatz, ProcDump, comsvcs.dll, or a custom tool — because all of them must access LSASS memory in a way that leaves a detectable behavioral footprint, regardless of file hash.

**Anomaly Detection Rules**establish a behavioral baseline per entity (user, host, service account, application) and alert on statistically significant deviations. They require historical data, a meaningful baseline period, and tolerance tuning. They are the hardest to build, the noisiest when poorly tuned, and the hardest for an adversary to evade in a well-baselined environment.

## Required Log Sources by Layer

**Rule format guide:**This article uses four distinct formats, indicated in each section header or code block:

## Atomic Event Rules

Atomic rules are the foundation. They are fast, deterministic, and directly traceable to a specific observable from a threat report. The key discipline is:**every atomic rule must cite its source**, have a defined false-positive profile, and be reviewed for continued relevance because indicators age out.

### 1. APT29 — SUNBURST DLL Loaded by SolarWinds Process

SUNBURST was delivered as a trojanized update to`SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll`. The backdoor checked for the presence of specific security tools and domains before activating, with a dormancy period of up to two weeks. The most reliable atomic indicator during initial triage was the combination of parent process, DLL path, and subsequent DNS activity.

  ensure every Orion DLL load is reviewed, not to declare an incident.

```

**Detection note:**This is a triage rule, not a high-confidence alert. It fires on the parent/child process relationship — which matches both the malicious and legitimate DLL equally. Every fire requires the analyst to compare the loaded DLL hash against vendor-supplied known-good values before any escalation. The rule’s value is ensuring no Orion DLL load goes unreviewed, not detecting the backdoor directly. Hash validation against vendor-supplied known-good values is a manual triage step: compare the loaded DLL hash against your approved SolarWinds baseline after the rule fires. This design keeps the detection alive against packer-modified variants while ensuring the analyst always verifies the hash before escalating.

### 2. APT41 — Web Shell Creation in IIS Web Root

APT41 consistently deploys web shells immediately after exploiting public-facing applications (Citrix, ManageEngine, Exchange). The shell is written to the web root by the compromised web application process. This is one of the highest-fidelity single-event detections available for this actor.

### 3. Lazarus — Trojanized Installer Executed from User Download Path

Lazarus’s AppleJeus and Dream Job operations deliver trojanized installers to targets, typically via spear-phishing or fake LinkedIn job offers. The trojanized application is executed from a user download or temp path and immediately spawns a child process inconsistent with the legitimate application behavior.

### 4. APT29 — TEARDROP Execution via Encoded Command

TEARDROP was APT29’s second-stage memory-only dropper used to load Cobalt Strike Beacons after SUNBURST. It was observed executing via heavily encoded PowerShell commands. The following rule detects the specific encoding pattern combined with a suspicious parent relationship.

### 5. Cross-Platform: Linux /proc/mem Access by Non-Root Process

On Linux, credential material is stored in process memory — SSH agent keys, sudo session tokens, cloud credential daemons (aws-credentials-helper, gcloud auth), and application secrets all live in the address space of running processes. Adversaries who compromise Linux hosts use`/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/mem`direct reads or`ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKDATA)`to extract credential material from live processes without touching disk. This is the functional Linux equivalent of LSASS memory access on Windows: the underlying technique is the same (read another process's memory to steal credentials), only the OS mechanism differs.

## Collection-Based Rules

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fGlrzWGOf3AwYr8VuQTCwA.png" alt="Article image" width="2816" height="1536" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

Collection rules introduce temporal context. Rather than a single event, they watch for a pattern of events of the same type accumulating over a time window. The key design decisions are: what to count, what entity to group by, and what threshold to use.

Thresholds should be derived from your baseline, not invented. If you don’t know your normal authentication failure rate, you will either miss attacks or generate constant noise.

&gt; Backend note: The rules in this section use Sigma’s aggregation syntax ( timeframe: + condition: ... | count() by ... ). This syntax is valid Sigma, but backend support varies. The Splunk, Elastic, and Sentinel backends in sigma-cli each transpile aggregation pipes differently. Test the transpiled output against your specific backend before deploying — the aggregated SPL or KQL may require minor adjustments to threshold syntax or field grouping.

### 1. APT29 — Spike in OAuth Token Requests from a New IP

APT29’s 2023–2024 Microsoft intrusion abused OAuth device-code flow to obtain tokens for Microsoft Graph API access. The pattern involved a single source IP generating many token requests across multiple accounts. A collection rule catches the volume before a correlational rule catches the sequence.

### 2. APT41 — Repeated Exploitation Attempts Against Same Service

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eEd2RG1fTtv-uazt0KnDRA.png" alt="Article image" width="2816" height="1536" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

APT41 systematically probes and exploits public-facing services. Their pattern frequently shows multiple exploitation payloads in rapid succession against the same endpoint — testing different bypass variants — before a successful shell. A collection rule on WAF/IDS events or web server error logs catches this preparatory phase.

### 3. Lazarus — Bulk File Staging Before Exfiltration

Before exfiltrating cryptocurrency wallet files or financial documents, Lazarus operators stage data by compressing it into archives. A collection rule watching for rapid creation of multiple archive files by a single process catches this staging behavior regardless of the specific archiver used.

## Correlational Rules

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uKopqTQlPjlUUiPpqJ-J4w.png" alt="Article image" width="2816" height="1536" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

Correlational rules are where detection becomes genuinely difficult for an adversary to evade without restructuring their operation. They require a SIEM capable of joining events across different log sources on a common entity — typically hostname, username, or process ID — within a defined time window.

The discipline here is choosing the right entities for joining and keeping correlation windows tight enough to reduce noise but wide enough to capture the actual technique timing.

### 1. APT29 — OAuth Token Grant Followed by Immediate Privileged Graph API Access

The 2024 Midnight Blizzard intrusion into Microsoft’s corporate network followed a specific sequence: device-code phishing → token grant → immediate access to Microsoft Graph API for email and file enumeration. The correlation across authentication logs and application activity logs is highly specific.

**PLATFORM-NATIVE ANALYTIC — Microsoft Sentinel KQL***(Not expressible as standard Sigma: requires cross-table join between SigninLogs and MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs with temporal window logic. Sigma has no native multi-source join or timeframe-with-offset semantics.)*

**Prerequisites:**

- `SigninLogs`ingested into Log Analytics workspace (Azure AD diagnostic settings)

- `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs`ingested (Microsoft 365 diagnostic settings → Log Analytics)

- Both tables must be present for the join to produce results

**False positives:**Legitimate users accessing email immediately after OAuth grant on a new device. Allowlist known corporate IP ranges and managed device identifiers.

**Confidence when fires:**Critical — device-code token grant → privileged Graph access within 5 minutes is highly anomalous.

### 2. APT41 — Exploitation → Web Shell → Lateral Movement Chain

APT41’s intrusion pattern is highly predictable: exploit a public-facing service, write a web shell, use the web shell to execute discovery commands, then move laterally via WMI or WinRM. Each step leaves traces in different log sources; the correlational rule joins them.

**PLATFORM-NATIVE DESIGN SPEC — Splunk SPL pseudocode***(Not expressible as standard Sigma: requires multi-event temporal join across three different log sources — Sysmon Event IDs 11, 1, and 3 — within a time-windowed sequence. Sigma has no native multi-source sequence correlation syntax.)*

**False positives:**Legitimate application deployments writing ASPX followed by diagnostics. Coordinate with change management to suppress during planned deployments.

**Confidence when fires:**Critical — three-phase chain within 30 minutes is high-confidence APT41-style post-exploitation.

### 3. Lazarus — Spear Phish Execution → Persistence → C2 Beacon

Dream Job and TraderTraitor operations follow a documented sequence: user opens a weaponized document or installer, a dropper establishes persistence (Run key or scheduled task), and then a C2 beacon makes its first outbound connection. The correlational rule joins process creation, registry modification, and network events.

## 7. TTP-Based Rules

TTP-based detection is the most durable layer. A rule that detects a technique survives tool changes, infrastructure rotation, and even operator changes within a group. The core insight:**every technique has a minimum behavioral footprint that no implementation can fully avoid**, because the footprint is determined by what the technique does to the operating system, not by how it does it.

### 1. LSASS Memory Access (T1003.001) — Technique Used by All Three Actor Groups

All three APTs use credential dumping. APT29 uses Mimikatz variants and custom tooling. APT41 uses ProcDump and comsvcs.dll. Lazarus uses custom LSASS readers. All of them must open a handle to`lsass.exe`with read-memory access rights. The TTP rule catches all variants.

```text

status: experimental
description: >
  Detects processes opening a handle to LSASS with memory-read access rights.
  This is the universal footprint of LSASS-based credential dumping regardless
  of the specific tool used — Mimikatz, ProcDump, comsvcs.dll MiniDump,
  custom loaders, or any other implementation must 
all open this handle.
  Used by APT29, APT41, and Lazarus Group in documented operations.

### 2. DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002) — Technique Illustrated by APT41 Operations

APT41 is one of the most consistent users of DLL side-loading in documented threat activity. The technique requires a signed legitimate executable loading an unsigned or attacker-controlled DLL from the same directory. The TTP rule detects this regardless of which signed binary is abused.

  a user-writable or non-standard path. DLL side-loading (T1574.002) is
  used to execute malicious code under the cover of a trusted process.
  This rule is technique-based — it does not care which binary is abused
  or which actor is operating. APT41 is used as the illustrative example
  because of their documented consistent use of this pattern, but the rule
  will fire on any actor that exploits this technique.

### 3. Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver — Lazarus POORTRY/WHIPEDOUT (T1014)

Lazarus used a Dell-signed but vulnerable driver (`DBUtil_2_3.sys`, later`POORTRY`) to disable EDR processes from kernel space. The BYOVD pattern produces two distinct detectable events: the driver load (Sysmon Event ID 6) and the subsequent security-tool process termination (Sysmon Event ID 5). These are written as two separate rules below. They must be correlated by the analyst or by a SIEM join within a 10-minute window on`host.name`— a single event alone is lower confidence.

&gt; WARNING: Never deploy hash-based rules with placeholder or unverified hashes. Pull current vulnerable driver hashes from https://www.loldrivers.io before production deployment. The example Dell DBUtil hash below is illustrative — verify it is still current and correct before use.

**Rule 3a — Vulnerable Driver Load (Sysmon Event ID 6)**

**Correlation note:**In Microsoft Sentinel, join these two rules on`Computer`(host) within a 10-minute window using a scheduled analytics rule. In Splunk, use`| join`on`host`across both searches within the same time window. A standalone fire of either rule alone warrants investigation but not incident declaration.

### 4. Golden SAML — APT29 Authentication Bypass (T1556.006)

Golden SAML attacks forge SAML assertions to authenticate as any user in federated identity environments. APT29 used this after compromising ADFS signing certificates. The behavioral footprint: a SAML authentication succeeds from an IP and device that have no prior authentication history, with no corresponding MFA event, for a highly privileged account.

**PLATFORM-NATIVE ANALYTIC — Microsoft Sentinel KQL***(No*`*detection:*`*block: this logic requires a*`*leftanti*`*join against a 30-day historical window and a Watchlist variable — constructs that have no equivalent in Sigma syntax. sigma-cli would reject a Sigma rule with no*`*detection:*`*block.)*

**False positives:**Legitimate federated sign-ins from new corporate IP ranges. Service accounts using certificate-based auth without MFA. Review with identity team before deploying.

**Confidence when fires:**Critical — SAML bypass with no MFA, new IP, and no prior history for a high-privileged account is highly anomalous.

## Anomaly Detection Rules

Anomaly detection moves from “did this specific bad thing happen” to “did this entity behave in a way inconsistent with its established baseline.” These rules are the hardest to build, require the most tuning, and produce the most initial noise — but they are also the hardest for a sophisticated adversary to evade in an environment where baselines are maintained.

The prerequisite for every anomaly rule: a meaningful baseline period (minimum 30 days, ideally 90) and a per-entity, not per-environment, baseline. A global threshold on a single metric will catch only the loudest signals.

### 1. APT29 — Service Account Accessing Resources at Anomalous Hours

APT29 uses compromised service accounts for long-dwell lateral movement. Service accounts have extremely predictable behavioral patterns — they typically authenticate at the same times, from the same systems, accessing the same resources. Any deviation is high-signal.

### 2. APT41 — Vendor Software Loading Anomalous DLL Count

APT41 abuses trusted software by planting DLLs in the application directory. A legitimate application’s DLL load profile is highly stable across versions — the same DLLs, from the same paths, in roughly the same order. A sudden expansion in the number or diversity of loaded DLLs from a vendor application is an anomaly that survives hash rotation.

### 3. Lazarus — Cryptocurrency Process Accessing Financial API Endpoints

TraderTraitor and AppleJeus operations target cryptocurrency exchange employees and software. Once access is gained, operators use the victim’s legitimate credentials and applications to interact with exchange APIs. An anomaly rule on the volume, timing, and destination of financial API calls from a user’s session can detect this — a user who normally executes 5–10 trades per day suddenly executing hundreds, or doing so at 3AM local time.

### 4. APT29 — Unusual Outbound Data Volume from Service Following Token Grant

APT29 post-compromise typically involves quiet, low-volume data exfiltration over extended periods — often weeks to months. But after a fresh OAuth token is issued, there is frequently a reconnaissance burst: the actor reads mailboxes, enumerates directories, or accesses SharePoint to map the environment. This produces a short-term data volume anomaly from the Microsoft Graph or Exchange APIs that is detectable against a per-account baseline.

## The Detection Chain: Layering All Five Tiers

Detection rules should not be evaluated in isolation. A single alert at any tier is an investigation trigger, not a confirmed incident. The value of layering is that correlation across tiers dramatically increases confidence and reduces analyst fatigue.

The following chain illustrates how all five tiers interact for the 3CX supply chain compromise (Lazarus Group, March 2023). 3CX is chosen because it demonstrates each tier firing on a different observable from the same incident — a property that makes it the clearest real-world example of why layers matter.

```

At each tier, the analyst answers a different question — illustrated here using the 3CX incident:

- **Atomic:**Does this specific DLL hash match a known-bad or non-baseline value for the 3CX application?

- **Collection:**Are multiple hosts hitting the same C2 infrastructure after a recent 3CX update at an abnormal rate?

- **Correlational:**Did the 3CX process spawn a shell and immediately fetch external binary data in the same session?

- **TTP:**Is a signed binary loading an unsigned DLL from its own directory, regardless of which binary or DLL name is involved?

- **Anomaly:**Is the service account associated with this application accessing systems and at times inconsistent with its 90-day behavioral baseline?

### Alert Weighting Model

A practical approach to managing alert volume across all five tiers is a per-incident risk score. Rather than treating each rule as a binary alert, assign a base score and let the score accumulate:

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TjDyv_zpElGLZZOkBmQR6g.png" alt="Article image" width="1081" height="624" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

Multiple simultaneous rule fires on the same entity within a time window should be multiplicatively weighted, not additively: an atomic IOC hit plus a TTP rule fire plus an anomaly alert on the same user, same hour, is almost certainly a real incident.

&gt; Scoring model disclaimer: The base scores and thresholds in this table are illustrative starting points, not validated empirical values. They must be calibrated against your environment’s actual false-positive rates and rule fidelity. Do not deploy with these exact numbers without a tuning period.

**Combined entity risk score formula:**When N rules fire on the same entity within the same detection window (60 minutes):

```text
combined_score
 = max(individual_scores) + Σ(remaining_scores × 
0.5
)
```

Example: TTP rule (70) + Anomaly multi-dimension (65) + Atomic behavioral (25) fire on the same user within the same hour:

```text
combined_score
 = 
70
 + (
65
 × 
0.5
) + (
25
 × 
0.5
) = 
70
 + 
32.5
 + 
12.5
 = 
115
 → Incident declaration
```

This formula prevents linear inflation while still rewarding corroborating signals. Adjust the 0.5 coefficient based on your environment’s baseline false-positive correlation. A coefficient closer to 1.0 rewards independent signals more aggressively; closer to 0.25 is appropriate when your rules share log sources and tend to co-fire on the same benign events.

## Tuning, Validation, and Measurement

### 1. Tuning Philosophy

The failure mode for atomic and collection rules is high false positive rate, leading to alert fatigue and rule bypass. The failure mode for TTP-based and anomaly rules is insufficient telemetry, leading to missed detections.

Tune in this order:

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nIX7fXxF21nWUyS5XphLyA.png" alt="Article image" width="803" height="1002" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

- **Start with the TTP-based rules.**They generate the fewest alerts but the most actionable ones. Tune the filter lists based on your legitimate software inventory.

- **Add correlational rules next.**They require joined telemetry, so identify data gaps first. A correlational rule that joins on a log source you don’t have will never fire — even if the attack is present.

- **Add collection rules.**Set thresholds from 30-day baseline data, not from intuition.

- **Add atomic rules last.**These are cheapest to write and burn fastest. Accept that they will need monthly review.

- **Deploy anomaly rules in monitor-only mode for the first 60 days.**Document the false positives, tune the entity exclusions, then set alert thresholds.

### 2. Validation: Testing Your Detection Coverage

Every rule should be tested before production deployment and periodically thereafter. The minimum validation set for each detection layer:

Reference datasets for validation:

- **Mordor (OTRF):**[github.com/OTRF/Security-Datasets](https://github.com/OTRF/Security-Datasets)— pre-recorded APT simulation telemetry

- **Atomic Red Team:**[github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team)— TTP-level test cases mapped to ATT&CK

- **EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES:**[github.com/sbousseaden/EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES](https://github.com/sbousseaden/EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES)— Windows event log samples per technique

### 3. Measuring Detection Coverage

Three complementary metrics matter:

**ATT&CK coverage score:**Map each rule you have to one or more ATT&CK technique IDs. Use the ATT&CK Navigator to visualize coverage gaps. A rule that fires on LSASS access covers T1003.001; a rule on web shell creation covers T1505.003. Build a coverage heatmap, prioritize the gaps that match your highest-priority adversary profiles.

**Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) by tier:**Log the time from simulated attack execution to alert generation for each tier. If your TTP-based rule for LSASS access takes 45 minutes to alert because of SIEM ingestion lag, that lag is the detection gap — address it in the data pipeline, not the rule.

**Alert fidelity rate:**Track confirmed true positives as a fraction of total alerts per rule over 30-day rolling windows. A rule below 10% fidelity rate should be tuned or retired. A rule at 100% fidelity over 90 days with zero fires should be tested — it may simply not be covering the technique it claims to cover.

### 4. Detection-as-Code Workflow

Sigma rules in this guide (Sections 4 and 5, and the TTP rules 7.1–7.3) follow a detection-as-code pipeline:

```text
CTI Report → Extract TTP
/
IOC → Write Sigma Rule → Code Review →

 main → sigma
-

```

Tools for this pipeline:

- [**sigma-cli**](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma-cli)**:**Convert Sigma to Splunk SPL, Microsoft Sentinel KQL, Elastic Lucene/ES|QL, and others

- [**pySigma**](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma)**:**Python library for programmatic Sigma rule management

- [**VECTR**](https://github.com/SecurityRiskAdvisors/VECTR)**:**Campaign tracking and red team exercise management (SecurityRiskAdvisors)

- [**MITRE ATT&CK Navigator**](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/)**:**Coverage visualization

&gt; Note for Elastic users: sigma-cli converts Sigma rules to Elastic Lucene queries and ES|QL via the elasticsearch or esql backend. It does not produce native EQL (Elastic Event Query Language), which has distinct sequence syntax ( sequence by ... [process where ...] [network where ...] ). The correlational rules in Section 6 that use EQL sequence syntax must be written or adapted manually — they cannot be auto-generated from Sigma using current backends (as of early 2026).

## Rule Lifecycle and Versioning

Detection rules are not static artifacts. They decay as infrastructure changes, attackers adapt, and platform schemas evolve. A production detection program needs an explicit lifecycle policy.

**Versioning convention**

Sigma rules carry a`date`and`modified`field. Use`modified`for all updates — it is the authoritative version timestamp. Do not change the`id`UUID when updating a rule: a new UUID means a new rule, not a version bump. The UUID must be stable across the entire lifecycle of a rule. Use the`modified`date for version tracking, not a new UUID. For teams that need explicit semantic versioning, add a`custom`field:

```text
custom:
  
version:
 
'1.3.0'
   
# major.minor.patch — increment patch for filter tuning,
                     
# minor for detection logic changes, major for technique scope changes
```

**Five-tier review cadence**

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pc92jx7M1daZNZ5qMKrHEw.png" alt="Article image" width="625" height="720" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

**Deprecation criteria**

A rule should be marked`status: deprecated`and removed from production deployment when any of the following apply:

- Its**fidelity rate**(confirmed true positives ÷ total alerts) drops below**5%**over a 90-day rolling window despite reasonable tuning effort

- Its**log source is decommissioned**or a platform schema change breaks one or more field names in the detection condition

- A**higher-tier rule fully subsumes its detection surface**: for example, a TTP-based LSASS rule that fires on all access-right patterns makes an older atomic rule that only checks one access mask redundant

Deprecated rules should be retained in source control with their`status: deprecated`flag and a comment explaining the deprecation reason and date. This preserves the analytical decision record and allows reactivation if the subsumption assumption later breaks.

**Stable UUIDs — the non-negotiable rule**

Every Sigma rule`id`field is a UUID that must never change after the rule is first published. If you fork a rule from the SigmaHQ repository and make changes, do not reuse the upstream UUID — generate a new one. Changing a UUID in your detection-as-code pipeline will break any alert tracking, suppression lists, or incident linkage that references the old UUID. Track what changed in`modified`, not in the`id`.

## Evasion Considerations: What Sophisticated Actors Do to Beat Each Layer

The most important thing a detection engineer can understand about their own rules is exactly how they fail. Each detection tier has a characteristic evasion path that a motivated actor can follow — and that evasion path reveals precisely why the next tier up exists. This section is written from the attacker’s perspective, because that is the only perspective that produces honest detection coverage assessment.

### 1. Evading Atomic Rules

Atomic rules match a specific observable: a file hash, an IP address, a domain name, a process name. The evasion options are trivial:

- **Hash rotation:**Recompile the payload with a different compiler flag, swap a packer, or change a single byte in a resource section. The resulting hash is completely different; the functionality is identical. This takes minutes with automated build pipelines.

- **Infrastructure rotation:**Rotate the C2 IP or domain before or immediately after the public report lands. Many sophisticated actors now run automated infrastructure provisioning that generates new IPs and domains on a schedule shorter than the typical report-to-blocklist lag. By the time an IOC appears in a threat feed and reaches a defender’s blocklist, it may already have been abandoned.

- **File path and name manipulation:**A name-based atomic rule (`Image|endswith: '\mimikatz.exe'`) is bypassed by renaming the binary. A rule that matches on both name and path is bypassed by moving it. Rules that depend on filenames rather than behavior are almost always trivially evaded.

- **Stage-1 loader swap:**Even if the final payload hash is known, dropping a new loader that fetches and executes the payload in memory means the file that lands on disk (the loader) has never been seen before.

**Key insight:**Evading an atomic rule costs the attacker minutes to hours. Rotating infrastructure is now automated in many actor toolchains, making IP/domain IOCs useful for retrospective attribution but unreliable as real-time detection. The value of atomic rules is speed of deployment during an active incident — not durability.

### 2. Evading Collection Rules

Collection rules fire when a count crosses a threshold within a time window. The evasion strategy is straightforward: operate below the threshold.

- **Rate reduction:**If your collection rule fires on &gt;10 OAuth token requests in 10 minutes from a single IP, spread the same 10 requests over 100 minutes. The individual events are identical; they simply no longer co-occur in the detection window.

- **Source IP diversification:**Use residential proxies, compromised hosts, or cloud egress nodes to spread the same volume across multiple source IPs. Each source IP individually stays below the threshold even as the aggregate attack volume is unchanged.

- **Threshold inference:**An attacker with access to your environment over an extended period can observe what volume of their own activity generates alerts. They calibrate their operational tempo to stay just below whatever ceiling your collection rules represent.

- **Timing jitter:**Automated tools that generate bursty traffic are easy to detect with collection rules. Introducing human-like jitter (random delays, diurnal variation in request rate) causes the traffic to blend into legitimate usage patterns that are statistically similar to what the collection rule is trying to flag.

**Key insight:**A collection rule with a fixed global threshold is a ceiling that a patient attacker learns to operate under. The correct design is per-entity dynamic thresholds — percentile-based, derived from that specific entity’s own baseline — rather than environment-wide static values. A threshold that is appropriate for a high-volume user is almost certainly wrong for a service account.

### 3. Evading Correlational Rules

Correlational rules join multiple events in a temporal sequence. Breaking any single link in the chain breaks the rule.

- **Deliberate timing delays:**If your correlational rule fires on “web shell creation followed by lateral movement within 30 minutes,” the attacker simply waits 45 minutes between the web shell deployment and the first lateral movement command. The events are real and detectable individually; they just fall outside the join window.

- **Tool substitution at one link:**A correlational rule that joins on specific process names (e.g.,`wmiprvse.exe`→ lateral movement) is broken by switching to a different lateral movement protocol that does not involve WMI — RDP, WinRM, SMB, SSH — because the named process no longer appears in the event stream at the expected link.

- **Living-off-the-land at the join point:**If the correlation depends on detecting an unusual process (e.g., PowerShell spawned by a web server process), switching to a LOLBin that is routinely present in the environment (certutil, bitsadmin, msiexec) can make the individual events indistinguishable from legitimate administrator behavior. The join still fires, but the false-positive rate of the rule climbs to the point where the alert is suppressed or ignored.

- **Multi-hop staging:**Rather than going directly from the compromised web server to lateral movement, an attacker can stage through an intermediate host that is not in your correlational rule’s scope, breaking the causal chain that the rule is designed to track.

**Key insight:**Correlational rules that join on process names rather than access patterns are broken by a single tool swap. The more durable design joins on what the process accessed, what permissions it requested, or what network destinations it reached — not what the executable was named. Behavioral joins survive tool changes; binary-name joins do not.

### 4. Evading TTP-Based Rules

TTP rules detect a technique regardless of the specific tool implementing it. Evading them requires actually changing the underlying operating system interaction — a much higher cost.

- **Memory-only techniques:**File-based TTP rules (DLL drops, web shell writes) are bypassed by moving entirely to memory-resident execution. Reflective DLL injection, process hollowing, and shellcode injected into existing processes produce no file creation events and do not trigger file-based TTP rules. LSASS access rules that rely on file-based indicators do not fire if credential dumping is performed via a legitimate API call that the rule does not monitor (e.g., SSP registration, shadow copies).

- **Kernel-mode execution (BYOVD):**TTP rules that monitor process-level behavior are bypassed entirely if the attacker operates from kernel space. A driver running at ring 0 can suppress, modify, or replay telemetry before it reaches the EDR agent. This is why BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) is specifically used to kill EDR processes before conducting the high-value action.

- **Abusing legitimate OS APIs:**A TTP rule for scheduled task creation that fires on`schtasks.exe`execution is bypassed by creating the scheduled task directly via the Task Scheduler COM API (`ITaskScheduler::AddWorkItem`) from within a trusted process. The task is created; no`schtasks.exe`process is spawned; the rule does not fire.

- **Legitimate tool execution:**If a TTP rule fires on PowerShell execution with encoded commands, switching to equivalent functionality in a language or runtime that is not monitored (Python via a legitimate interpreter, AutoHotkey, JScript in a .hta file) may achieve the same goal outside the detection perimeter.

**Key insight:**TTP rules fail when the technique’s required OS interaction is functionally indistinguishable from a legitimate privileged operation performed by the same class of process. The solution is not more pattern-matching on what the binary is called — it is contextual enrichment: who is calling this API, from which parent process, at what time, on what data, with what access rights. Context is what TTP rules alone cannot provide; anomaly detection and correlational rules supply the context.

### 5. Evading Anomaly Rules

**Anomaly detection is the hardest tier to evade**, and the evasion strategies are correspondingly more sophisticated and time-intensive.

- **Slow baseline poisoning:**Operate at low, legitimate-looking volume for 90 days or more before executing the high-value action. If the attacker’s traffic during the baselining period is indistinguishable from legitimate activity (because it IS low-volume legitimate-looking activity), the baseline absorbs it. When the attacker finally increases volume or changes behavior, the new baseline includes the attacker’s footprint, and the anomaly threshold is set relative to a contaminated baseline. This requires long dwell time but is within reach of patient state-sponsored actors with 6–12 month pre-positioning timelines.

- **Behavioral mimicry:**If the attacker has observed the victim’s behavioral patterns (working hours, typical API call volume, device fingerprint, geographic login locations), they can deliberately mimic those patterns to remain within the normal band. A victim who always logs in from London between 09:00–17:00 and generates 50 API calls per session is relatively easy to impersonate if the attacker knows those parameters.

- **Targeting baselining gaps:**Anomaly detection requires a baseline. New users, recently provisioned service accounts, new applications, or systems onboarded after a major change have short or absent baseline histories. These entities have high uncertainty in their anomaly models and are therefore poor targets for anomaly detection but excellent targets for attackers. A new employee’s account has no established behavioral baseline; any activity from it is, by definition, “normal” for that entity.

- **Baselining horizon exploitation:**Most anomaly rules use a fixed lookback window (30, 60, 90 days). An attacker who compromises an account, conducts low-volume operations for 31 days, and then escalates has effectively aged their malicious activity outside the short-term anomaly window while remaining inside the baseline period — making their activity look like an established pattern.

**Key insight:**A well-resourced actor who has already conducted extensive reconnaissance may understand your environment’s behavioral baseline better than your own detection team does. Anomaly detection is hardest against patient actors with long dwell times — precisely the actors who represent the highest risk. The correct response is not to abandon anomaly detection but to ensure that the baseline includes multiple dimensions simultaneously (time, volume, geography, access pattern) so that mimicking all dimensions simultaneously becomes operationally difficult.

### Synthesis: Why Layering Is the Only Correct Answer

Each tier’s characteristic evasion path assumes the attacker is operating as if that tier were the only detection mechanism in place. An attacker who rotates hashes to evade atomic rules has not changed their tool, their technique, or their behavioral pattern — all of which remain visible to higher tiers. An attacker who slows their rate to evade a collection threshold has not changed the sequence of actions they take — which remains visible to correlational and TTP-based rules. An attacker who switches tools to break a correlational rule has still executed the same underlying technique, which remains visible to TTP-based detection. And an attacker who operates below every static rule threshold has still, inevitably, changed their behavior relative to what was normal for the compromised entity — which anomaly detection is designed to catch.

No single tier is sufficient. The correct architecture is all five tiers running simultaneously, with alert scoring that aggregates signals across tiers for the same entity within the same time window. An attacker who has successfully evaded four tiers while still being caught by the fifth has not successfully evaded your detection program.
